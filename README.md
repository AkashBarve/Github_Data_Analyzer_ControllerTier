This is the repository which has code for connecting the project https://github.com/AkashBarve/Github_Data_Analyzer to UF's CISE Oracle database using Nodejs.

Currently it has sample code with credentials which allows printing results of queries on the Database on your local Node console

Steps to follow for Windows system

-- Install Node.js on your system.

-- Execute npm install in the directory

-- If package does not install oracledb, execute npm install oracledb

-- Get the libraries by downloading and unzipping the free Oracle Instant Client “Basic” or “Basic Light” package for your operating system architecture.
   Instant Client on Windows requires an appropriate Visual Studio Redistributable.
   More info: https://oracle.github.io/node-oracledb/INSTALL.html#quickstart

-- Make sure you are connected to the UF VPN

-- Execute node connection.js/ node dbconfig.js/ node script.js to see how this works. 

Further updates will be made soon.
